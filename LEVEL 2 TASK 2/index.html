            <h1>EARLY CAREER</h1>
            <h2>...</h2>
            <p>Back in 1935, the father of the veteran singer, started her music training. And many few of us know that before making their singing debut she made her acting debut as a child actress in Mangeshkar Sr's Marathi musical plays. Kickstarting her singing career, Lata Ji sang two songs in the studio for the first time for the radio. The singer was just 12 years old when she professionally sang for the first time on December 16, 1941. Things went off the track when her father died in 1942 but her close family friend helped her get things back on track and gave her a chance to act in Navyug Chitrapat's Marathi movie 'Pahili Mangalaa-gaur', and sing 'Natali Chaitraachi Navalaai' in the movie.</p>

            <p>After making her mark in the Marathi industry, she sang her first Hindi song Mata Ek Sapoot Ki Duniya Badal De Tu' in 1945.  And then came the time when she left the whole nation and even the prime minister Jawahar Lal Nehru, teared with her soulful song, Ae Mere Watan Ke logo. This was the year when Mangeshkar's association with music directors Laxmikant–Pyarelal began. The singer gave voice to many of their compositions and the collaboration kept growing stronger. Some popular names include 'Mr. X in Bombay', 'Mere Hamdam Mere Dost', 'Intaquam, 'Do Raaste', among others.</p>
